Reaktor fast track problem solution
=============

My solution for one of the Reaktor fast-track problems published during the spring 2014. The problem was to find the largest sum along the route from the top of a tree to the bottom without examining every possible path. The best path is the one with largest cumulative sum from the nodes.
