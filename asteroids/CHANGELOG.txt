12.12.2012, 15:46: Fixed that the missiles get destroyed also in the collision with asteroids.
                   Adjusted the speed of the missiles.
                   
            17:12: Added support for multiple simultaneous key presses.
            
            17:43: Optimized some aspects of the sprites, there is still a weird but that the sprites
                   don't return their width and height correctly.
                   
            18:09: Gapped the player's total velocity to a given range [0, PLAYER_MAX_VELOCITY], it's a
                   bit silly implementation but will do for now.
                   
            18:23: Added dampening (global DAMPENING) to smooth the movement of the player.
            
            18:49: Added background.
            
            19:06: Fixed the focus in the HTML. Now the canvas gets focus without clicking first.

            
13.12.2012, 01:44: Added some split sprites with transparent backgrounds.
            
            03:34: For fucks sake really. Ok I did some further advances with sprites etc, but there is
                   some bug in the sprite image loading. The image dimensions return 0, which screws up
                   the creation of the bounding boxes for the elements. Currently the real versions are
                   commented out and constant values are given as placeholders.
                   
            13:44: Fixed the bug concerning the sprites. There can be only one @pjs preload directive at
                   the beginning of the file, which caused the problem. The circumcircles etc are now
                   being calculated correctly. I also added a debugging mode that shows the circles by
                   setting the global DEBUG flag as true.
                   
            17:24: Experimented with audio, added shooting effect and AudioFX library. This looks like a
                   viable option for our game. Obviously the sounds etc. need to be incorporated into
                   the classes or in some other structured way, not a global variable like its atm. For
                   more info: http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/9/17/revisiting_html5_audio/


14.12.2012, 23:48 Start Screen. New level with more asteroids after all asteroids are destroyed. If player
		  is hit by asteroid Start Screen reappears.
