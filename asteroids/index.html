                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>Welcome to play the A!STEROIDS game that we've created as out school project for the Digital Media Tools course. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The game was created using Processing JS and AudioFX JavaScript libraries along with appropriate sound effects and graphical elements. All the elements that were used and not created by ourselves were free and under Creative Commons or otherwise royalty free licenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                There is a distinct purpose to continue the project to some extent even after the course to add a couple of more features such as a high score list with a backend and possible multiplayer support. However please enjoy the fruits of our work as of now.
                </p>
                <p>
                The game has been tested with Windows 7 Professional x64, using the latest Google Chrome version 23.0.1271.97m. We do not guarantee perfect functionality with different environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                Sincerely,
                <br /><br />
